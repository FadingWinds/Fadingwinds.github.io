There are several things people can do to test out a product. In this post I combine prototypes together with personas and storytelling, but in fact they are NOT really part of prototypes.

### Designers Oriented

Methods that don't necessarily involve users.

#### Personas

A fictional character that is meant to represent a group of users that share common goals, attitudes and behaviors when interacting with a particular product or service.

Steps:

1. Collect data of users.
2. Segment the users.
3. Create personas.

Personas can help designers have **empathy**.

Question from myself: how do you decide whether a persona is logical or realistic?

It's easy to find online tools to help you design a persona.

#### Scenarios

Written accounts and narratives of an experience. Imagining a particular situation personas encounter.

Components: motivation, context, distractions, goal

#### Storyboarding

Illustrations(drawings) that represent a story. Here's a storyboard I drew in class:

<br>
<div align = center><img src = "https://od.lk/s/MzBfMTgwMDQxMDFf/storyboard.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" title = "My Drawing of Storyboard"/></div>

It's about a situation where people have issues when using smart home devices.

Compared with actually "telling" a story, it's more direct and could convey more information with less content (save paper :wink:).

Some rules:

- Only include necessary details. 
- Be proud to be a terrible painter.
- The number of frames should be around six.

### Users Oriented

Requires the engagement of users.

#### Prototype

Simulate the design with low cost. Could be done iteratively during design.

Two ways of prototyping:

- Vertical: show only part of the interface, but very detailed.
- Horizontal: show many aspects of the interface in a shallow manner.

#### Low Fidelity: Paper Prototype

Although it sounds more complicated, in fact it's **much easier and faster** to implement compared with prototyping with fancy tools, even if you're a terrible painter.

It helps designers and users **focus on big things**, e.g. interface logics, instead of spending hours trying to choose a perfect font (that's what I usually did...)

You are more likely to get "honest" feedback with paper prototype because, people will hesitate to say something negative if they realize you have put a large amount of work into it.

**Generally it kind of looks like the expensive and fancy cards that were popular among primary school students.*

#### High Fidelity: Digital Prototype

Tools: Figma, Invision, Sketch, and my favorite - **Proto.io**.
