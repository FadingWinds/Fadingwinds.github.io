#### Definition
Contextual inquiry is a qualitative research method. The researcher will give participants a topic to do something, then observe and ask probing questions.

#### More Explanation
- It takes place in the context of use, e.g. where (home/work)  people will use your app product.
- The purpose is to understand why people do certain things and enhance user experience.
- It's a very "free" research method. 

#### Strategy
- Use "participant" instead of "user" or "subject" in the research to connote an active role.
- Introduce the research method to participants and make sure they know that it's the product that is being tested.
- Explain your conclusions and interpretations to participants through out the interview to avoid any misunderstanding.

#### Notes
- Start data analysis ASAP.
- Contextual inquiry can be conducted in any stage of design.

#### My Thoughts

When you ask the participants why they do something in a contextual inquiry, they might realize things that they never noticed before. So does **psychology**. 

Just have a friend keep asking questions when describing experiences or stating points can be really helpful. When people thinking by themselves, it's easy for them to "fall into routines" and take something for granted. Even if they try to remind themselves from time to time, it's still not as good as a different perspective.

It can also be applied to **science**, at least in the past, when no one had been curious enough about the reasons behind falling apples. In general, "why" questions can be annoying, but lose the ability to wonder...it seems way more worse to me.
