### Cognitive Biases

The picture below has done a great work summarizing this topic.

Some thoughts:

- Will the biases cancel each other under certain circumstances?

#### Making a resolution?

A resolution may be wrong for one of three main reasons:

- It’s a resolution created based on what someone else (or society) is telling you to change.
- It’s too vague.
- You don’t have a realistic plan for achieving your resolution.

Make **SMART** goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.

To figure out how to change a habit, try breaking it down into three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward. It's important to know why you do (or can't do) something so you could control it.

<summary>Example here</summary>
Bad Habit: I don't get enough sleep at night.

Cue: I feel like I need time to myself in the evening.

Routine: I stay up too late watching TV.

Reward: I'm entertained.

Way to change the behavior: Instead of staying up late to watch TV, carve out special time each day to spend by yourself, even if that may mean asking for help with your children or taking a break from work each day.
</details>

A plan should allow some inevitable situations (slip days, or I would like to call "fault tolerance") and prepare for them before they actually show up. Some useful technique include:

- Focus on the small one between what is done and what left.
- **Don't be too positive** because who needs a real achievement if already enjoying a fantastic daydream? Try W.O.O.P.: Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan.

To keep up the resolution, other things might help are:

- Tell someone(or post on public platform even if nobody reads it) about your plan.
- Make yourself lose something if you fail. Money is a good choice.
- Find a group to get some good peer pressure.
- **Do a "stress test" before it start to know how feasible it is.**
