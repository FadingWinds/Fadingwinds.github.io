### **Surveys**
Sort of quantitative methods.

#### Strategy
- Identify topics needed to be covered.
- Pretest drafts.
- Cross-sectional: different people in same population at multiple points in time.
- Panel / longitudinal: same people over time.
- Use open-ended questions in pilot tests and then use the answers to form close-ended ones.

#### Rules
- Use the same question wording and be careful about where the question is asked.
- The number of choices should be a small number -- 4 or 5 usually.
- Randomize the order of options to reduce potential bias, except for ordinal ones (e.g. from "most" to "least").
- Ask **clear** and **specific** questions. Use simple and concrete language.
- Only ask **1** question at a time. Don't indicate two or more things.
- Be careful not to use biased or potentially offensive to certain respondents. (e.g. biological sex)
- Questions should be grouped and asked in a logical order.

#### Fun Facts
- People tend to choose the options they heard later in a list (recency effect).
- Compared with the better educated and better informed, less educated and less informed respondents have a greater tendency to agree with certain statements.
- People have a natural tendency to want to be accepted and liked, and this may lead people to provide inaccurate answers to questions that deal with sensitive subjects. 

### **Interviews**
Qualitative research method.

#### Strategy
- Write a general interview guide.
- Modify questions if necessary after each interview.
- Explain the purpose, format, length etc. of the interview. Let the participants ask questions before start the interview.
- **Never** count on memories to recall the answers. 
- Encourage the participants with nodding, etc.
- Careful with reactions (act surprised or take notes suddenly may discourage the participants), tolerate pauses, show you are listening.
- Stay focused on the topic, don't lose control of the interview.
- Begin with a warm-up question -- simple and easy to answer.
- The last question should provide some closure for the interview.

#### Rules 
- When there're multiple interviewers, make sure to use the same wordings.
- Be careful to ask "why" questions. Could be hard to answer or, just, annoying. Ask "how" instead.
- Never answer a question for the respondent.
- Ask questions that could elicit long answers.
- Don't ask about general things and let the respondent answer on behalf of a group. 
- Complete the scripts right after the interview. Don't wait for a long time.
