### <font color = #7cd175> REGULATIONS </font>

Similar to academic integrity, <font color = #b39ddb>***DoveCode***</font> respects and protects all kinds of intellectual property rights. Most content in this website follows *Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License*, and any exception will be stated.

If you would like to "clone" something but couldn't get the access to it, please contact [@FadingWinds](https://FadingWinds.me/about) and I would love to help. Also, it is very encouraged to point out any mistakes or missing points you notice. 

### <font color = #7cd175> REFERENCES </font>

1. <font color = #b39ddb>***DoveCode***</font> is based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and uses [hexo-theme-matery](https://github.com/blinkfox/hexo-theme-matery/) as the theme. Currently all the functions and plugins are derived from them, so references like these won't be listed here right now. Please visit their link to see the details.
2. The banner picture comes from **Cytus II** (A game produce by [Rayark](https://www.rayark.com/)).

3. Sorry it was unable for me to trace the resource of the website's logo (which is also my avatar image on Github). I would be grateful if anyone happens to know and could provide it to me.
