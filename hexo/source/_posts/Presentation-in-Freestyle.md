  Today I took part in a workshop related to presentation skills as a Studio session. Personally, when giving presentations, there's one thing that has always been difficult for me. Although I could remember all the content (let's say I could:neutral_face:) and present in front of people with some kind of confidence, somehow it feels like I'm just doing a perfect job in reciting or remembering all the gestures instead of really trying to convey or explain something I know about, even if it was created completely by myself. What I want to be is a presenter in freestyle -- well, like dancing to the music without choreography:wink:.
  
  Ambitions:
  - Actually pay attention to the audience. Don't see them as a group (background image).
  - Walk around and use body language naturally, in contrast to imitating a robot. 
  - Humorous, at least 80% of what I will show in daily life.
  - Handle different kinds of situations without too much struggle. Like a comedian.
  
  So, with these ambitions, and also a bit of sleepiness:unamused:, I went to the workshop and learned:
  - **Eye contact** is very important. Also make sure to look at people that not in the center.
  - Must have a strong and clear **ending** (not the kind of 'that's all').
  
  Ummm...okay, it was a really good workshop, and I definitely learned more than 2 things. The rest is just all combined with my own thoughts, such as:
  - Personally: keep my hands away from my hair. Just try to hold something, like a chair or a pen. (Otherwise I will need a shave to fix this habit:smirk:)
  - Don't let the audience lose focus for a long period of time(30 seconds perhaps?). Example: write something on the board, deal with slides.
  - Suppose that you could memorize all the content and you just want to practice your presentation style. An interesting way I came up with: present with another language that your audience don't understand at all, or just ramble words that make no sense, or remain silence, while **you still have a topic to convey**. Kind of like the game to guess a word. I think this will help you focus on the interaction and connection.
  - Sometimes be completely honest with the audience will help a lot. I mean, suppose you made a mistake during a lecture, if you don't have the ability to fix it or act as nothing happened immediately yet, just show them how you are speaking to yourself "uh-oh." Maybe some non-related explanation: I played video games until 4 this morning so don't expect me to know what I'm talking about. But definitely not too much so you will still be on the content.
  
  Okay, that's pretty much it. I'm running to do my AML homework now.

  Not a bad article for my first post...I guess?
