Little Abigail, just a bit younger

Silently floating without a feather

How did you even let her get in your space

Don't you know she belongs to another place

<br>

You always stare, into those eyes

But they won't give away

What's on her mind

Little Abigail, is she doomed to fail

To let her slow pace make you left her behind

<br>

One piece of existence

Expected as assistance

Present for distance

Excuse for disappearance

Sent to your hand now

Abigail's flower

If somehow

This world still needs her little power

<br>

She will send away the darkness

On a fireless night

Hounds and spiders are no longer your threat 

She'd take a deerclops if it dares to attack

Please do not fret

If she's out of your sight

It's just she always gets another battle to fight

Soon before you know, she will come back

Never miss a day to protect, not in this life

<br>

Little Abigail, dear sister

Ongoing time heals or generates sorrow

Vermilion petals preserve her smile no matter

Everywhere and every tomorrow

<br>
<br>
