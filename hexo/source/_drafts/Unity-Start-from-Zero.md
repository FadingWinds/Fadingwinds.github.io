### Why learn? | 学习动机

This may sound a little cliché. I had been dreaming to become a writer since primary school, and for the past couple of years, I've realized that the more precise phrase to describe "my dream" is being a storyteller, and writing is just my favorite way of it.

I soon discovered another way when I played the game *To The Moon*, which I still feel very lucky and grateful. It's magnificent in any level, and it showed me how gaming could be a unique and impressive method of telling a story. Then, last year, I encountered an experience, an extraordinary story that I felt the impulse of telling it echoing with my heartbeats, and any other form just seems to be not enough to convey. That's when I decided I want to write a game by myself.

Choosing what to use to design the game was hard for me since I had no experience before. The tool of my inspiration, RPG Maker MV, failed to become my prior choice only because I'm not really a fan of 2D Retro Style. By contrast, Unity seems so perfect and interesting that its complexity and difficulty won't stop me from learning it. I know it could help me build what I want, and as long as that stays true, perseverance and hard work are just things under my control.
