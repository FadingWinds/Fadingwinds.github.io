## Theories and Methods

### Dynamic Programming

#### Situation

A duplicate process, overlapping subproblems

Recursion in brute force, optimal substructure

#### Methods

- Memorization
- Table filling

## Examples of Problem/Solution

- Find the $N^{th}$ fibonacci number. [Dynamic Programming]
- Given two strings s and t, find the longest subsequence (same order but can skip some letters) common to both strings. [Dynamic Programming]
- Given array $a$ containing integers $[x_1, …, x_n]$, find integers $i, j$ such that $1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n$ and $\Sigma^{j}_{i}a$ is maximal.


## Application Reflex

## Others

### Tips

- Usually recursion takes more space and runs faster, while the "for" loop is the opposite.
