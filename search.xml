        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  Today I took part in a workshop related to presentation skills as a Studio session. Personally, when giving presentations, there’s one thing that has always been difficult for me. Although I could remember all the content (let’s say I could<span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f610.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f610.png?v8">😐</span>) and present in front of people with some kind of confidence, somehow it feels like I’m just doing a perfect job in reciting or remembering all the gestures instead of really trying to convey or explain something I know about, even if it was created completely by myself. What I want to be is a presenter in freestyle – well, like dancing to the music without choreography<span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png?v8">😉</span>.</p><p>  Ambitions:</p><ul><li><p>Actually pay attention to the audience. Don’t see them as a group (background image).</p></li><li><p>Walk around and use body language naturally, in contrast to imitating a robot. </p></li><li><p>Humorous, at least 80% of what I will show in daily life.</p></li><li><p>Handle different kinds of situations without too much struggle. Like a comedian.</p><p>So, with these ambitions, and also a bit of sleepiness<span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f612.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f612.png?v8">😒</span>, I went to the workshop and learned:</p></li><li><p><strong>Eye contact</strong> is very important. Also make sure to look at people that not in the center.</p></li><li><p>Must have a strong and clear <strong>ending</strong> (not the kind of ‘that’s all’).</p><p>Ummm…okay, it was a really good workshop, and I definitely learned more than 2 things. The rest is just all combined with my own thoughts, such as:</p></li><li><p>Personally: keep my hands away from my hair. Just try to hold something, like a chair or a pen. (Otherwise I will need a shave to fix this habit<span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60f.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60f.png?v8">😏</span>)</p></li><li><p>Don’t let the audience lose focus for a long period of time(30 seconds perhaps?). Example: write something on the board, deal with slides.</p></li><li><p>Suppose that you could memorize all the content and you just want to practice your presentation style. An interesting way I came up with: present with another language that your audience don’t understand at all, or just ramble words that make no sense, or remain silence, while <strong>you still have a topic to convey</strong>. Kind of like the game to guess a word. I think this will help you focus on the interaction and connection.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes be completely honest with the audience will help a lot. I mean, suppose you made a mistake during a lecture, if you don’t have the ability to fix it or act as nothing happened immediately yet, just show them how you are speaking to yourself “uh-oh.” Maybe some non-related explanation: I played video games until 4 this morning so don’t expect me to know what I’m talking about. But definitely not too much so you will still be on the content.</p><p>Okay, that’s pretty much it. I’m running to do my AML homework now.</p><p>中文版的内容就不写了……</p><p>我的真·第一篇发布的文章居然是这个主题=_=</p></li></ul><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
